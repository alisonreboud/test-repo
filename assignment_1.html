    <p> For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:
      <ul>
        <li>What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data?</li>
        <li>What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</li>
        <li>Who is the intended audience?</li>
        <li>A sketch/mockup of the visualization.</li>
