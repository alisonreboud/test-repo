      <p>Positive and negative aspects:
        <br>
        Pos - Includes video of speaker presenting the data, which adds to the engagement factor and adds further explanation of the data
        <br>
        Neg - The listener can't interact with the data themselves
      </p>

      <p>Positive and negative aspects:
        <br>
        Pos - Interesting way to numerically visualise and compare something that isn't usually thought of numerically or numerically compared! It is interactive, using the hover function for more info. They also reference where the data came from, which I was interested in.
        <br>
        Neg - Nothing, though perhaps could increase interactiveness by allowing interactor to input their own daily routine  for comparison.

    <p> For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:
      <ul>
        <li>1. What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data?</li>
        <li>2. What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</li>
        <li>3. Who is the intended audience?</li>
        <li>4. A sketch/mockup of the visualization.</li>
      </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>1. I would like to visual my bank account statements real-time, to help me keep track of how i'm spending! My bank website has some visualisation and personalisability for what is visualised, but I would like to play around with this. I can download my bank statements. A problem is that I don't know if I can download this data real-time without having a program that can log itself into my bank account online to download the data daily/weekly..</li>
          <li>2. Visualisation would tell the story of how I am spending my money, in what areas (e.g. food, bars) and when. I'm not sure if text would add value to this, unless perhaps I had warnings saying something like "You should watch your spending next week!" </li>
          <li>3. Me. Perhaps others would also like to use the same visualisation for themselves with their own bank account. </li>
          <li>4.

      <p> 1. I would like to visualise prices of given items in different supermarkets to help me get the best deal!</p>

       <p>1. I would like to visualise openly available data from public institutions to illustrate demographic trends. I would get it from projects like http://data.kk.dk/ </p>
       <p>2. It would bring certain topics into perspective and would eventually make insights and symptom-origin relationships visible, like visualising income, education, origin </p> 
       <p>3. Fellow students, scientists, politicians </p>
