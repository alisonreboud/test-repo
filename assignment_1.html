      <p>Positive and negative aspects:
        <br>
        Pos - Includes video of speaker presenting the data, which adds to the engagement factor and adds further explanation of the data
        <br>
        Neg - The listener can't interact with the data themselves
      </p>

      <p>Positive and negative aspects:
        <br>
        Pos - Interesting way to numerically visualise and compare something that isn't usually thought of numerically or numerically compared! It is interactive, using the hover function for more info. They also reference where the data came from, which I was interested in.
        <br>
        Neg - Nothing, though perhaps could increase interactiveness by allowing interactor to input their own daily routine  for comparison.

    <p> For each member in the group, describe an interactive visualization that you would like to be able to build after this course has finished (just create a header for each group member on the .html page). If possible include elements like:
      <ul>
        <li>1. What type of data would you like to visualize, and where would you get access to this data?</li>
        <li>2. What story would the combination of text and visualization tell?</li>
        <li>3. Who is the intended audience?</li>
        <li>4. A sketch/mockup of the visualization.</li>
      </ul>
